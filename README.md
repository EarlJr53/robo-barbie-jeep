# Sidewalk Detection

Our project is a sidewalk detection algorithm. The envisioned application of the project is to be deployed, running on a Raspberry Pi, to allow for a Power Wheels vehicle to autonomously navigate around the sidewalks of the Olin campus. We initially wanted to actually implement the driving part of the project, but realized that spending our time on the detection and path planning would be better suited to the scope of the class. In its current state, we can process either live video directly on-device on a Raspberry Pi, or pre-recorded footage on a laptop, detecting sidewalk bounds and determining which direction to turn to remain on the sidewalk.
